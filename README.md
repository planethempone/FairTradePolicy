Core Principles of Planet Hemp’s Fair Trade Policy

Planet Hemp actively champions Fair Trade practices, emphasizing that this commitment is central to its identity as a cooperative. The policy is built upon several foundational pillars:

1. Fair Prices and Economic Empowerment
Fair Compensation: The policy ensures that hemp producers and farmers are paid fair prices for their products. This pricing model aims to cover the costs of sustainable production and provide the farmers and their families with a decent standard of living, directly improving their livelihoods.
Alleviating Poverty: By creating employment opportunities across the hemp value chain and ensuring fair wages, Planet Hemp seeks to alleviate poverty and promote financial independence, particularly within local and regional communities.
Resource Access: They are committed to providing comprehensive training and access to essential resources for hemp cultivation and processing, equipping local communities with the capabilities to become self-sufficient.

2. Ethical Labor and Human Rights
Dignity and Respect: The policy mandates that all participants in the supply chain, from farmers to workers, are treated with dignity and respect.
Safe Working Conditions: Commitment extends to upholding labor laws and guaranteeing safe and healthy working conditions, as well as offering opportunities for advancement.
Transparency and Accountability: As a cooperative, Planet Hemp fosters a culture of transparency and accountability. This means operating with open communication and actively engaging members in decision-making processes, which extends to ensuring fair trade practices are followed.

3. Environmental Sustainability
Eco-Friendly Cultivation: Fair Trade in this context is intrinsically linked to environmental stewardship. Planet Hemp promotes sustainable hemp production practices that minimize environmental impact.
Hemp’s Benefits: The policy leverages the natural benefits of hemp, such as its minimal water requirements compared to cotton and its suitability as a rotation crop, to ensure environmentally friendly sourcing.
Circular Economy: The commitment includes embracing principles of the circular economy—reducing waste, using resources efficiently, and responsibly managing the product lifecycle.

4. Supply Chain Sourcing and Engagement
Sourcing from Fair Trade Producers: Planet Hemp actively commits to sourcing its hemp products from certified or verified fair trade producers. This ensures its partners meet established fair trade labor and environmental standards.
Direct Relationships (Implied): By working closely with small-to-medium-sized, often family-owned, suppliers (due to the smaller hemp market), Planet Hemp can maintain great relationships and ensure quality over quantity, facilitating more transparent, mutually beneficial trade terms.
Advocacy and Education: The policy includes promoting fair trade by educating customers on its benefits and advocating for fair trade policies at broader levels.

The Cooperative Model’s Role
The very structure of Planet Hemp as a cooperative reinforces its Fair Trade Policy, making the principles of fairness and ethical treatment central to its business model:

Member Ownership: The co-op is owned and democratically controlled by its members (stakeholders), ensuring decisions are not solely driven by external shareholder profit but align with the interests of all participants, particularly the producers.
Accountability: This structure creates a strong culture of accountability, where decisions regarding sourcing, pricing, and labor practices are subject to internal oversight and member engagement.
In summary, Planet Hemp views its Fair Trade Policy not as a separate certification to be acquired, but as a fundamental operating philosophy. It aims to utilize the sustainable potential of hemp while simultaneously creating a socially just and economically equitable supply chain, thereby contrasting with traditional corporate models that may prioritize profits over the well-being of the primary producers.
